# Bun Configuration for Corporate Deployments
# This file configures Bun to use your organization's private npm registry

# Default registry configuration
[install]
# Replace with your corporate registry URL
# Examples:
# - Artifactory: https://artifactory.company.com/artifactory/api/npm/npm-virtual
# - Nexus: https://nexus.company.com/repository/npm-group
# - Verdaccio: https://npm.company.com
# - GitHub Packages: https://npm.pkg.github.com
registry = "https://registry.npmjs.org/"  # Default to public npm (change this!)

# Optional: Configure specific scopes to different registries
[install.scopes]
# Organization packages
# "@your-org" = { token = "$NPM_TOKEN", url = "https://npm.company.com/" }

# Public packages from npm (if using private registry as default)
# "@radix-ui" = { url = "https://registry.npmjs.org/" }
# "@tanstack" = { url = "https://registry.npmjs.org/" }

# Authentication via environment variable (SAFE TO COMMIT)
# Set NPM_TOKEN in your .env file (see .env.example)
# Bun will automatically substitute ${NPM_TOKEN} with the value

# Example configuration for corporate deployment:
#
# [install]
# registry = "https://npm.company.com/"
#
# [install.scopes]
# "@your-org" = { token = "$NPM_TOKEN", url = "https://npm.company.com/" }
# "@radix-ui" = { url = "https://registry.npmjs.org/" }
# "@tanstack" = { url = "https://registry.npmjs.org/" }

# Performance optimizations
[install.cache]
# Cache packages for faster installs
disable = false

# Optional: Configure specific package settings
# [install.peer]
# # Auto-install peer dependencies
# auto-install = true
